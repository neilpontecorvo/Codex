# iOS App

This directory contains a minimal SwiftUI project that displays the web-based life calculator using a `WKWebView`. The `WebResources` folder includes a copy of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

Open the folder in Xcode and create a new project. Add these files to the project and ensure the resources are included in the app bundle.
