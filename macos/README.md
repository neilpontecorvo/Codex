# macOS App

This directory contains a minimal SwiftUI macOS application that loads the life calculator web app using `WKWebView`. The `WebResources` folder contains copies of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

Open the folder in Xcode and create a new macOS project. Add these files and include the resources in the application bundle.
